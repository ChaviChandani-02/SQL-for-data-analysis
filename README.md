# SQL-for-data-analysis

# Objective:

The goal of this task was to learn how to use SQL to extract, manipulate, and analyze structured data from an eCommerce-style database using core SQL features such as SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, JOINS, subqueries, aggregate functions, views, and indexing.

# what i did:

1. Created a sample eCommerce database with four tables: customers, products, orders, and order_items.

2. Inserted sample data to simulate real-world transactions.

3. Wrote SQL queries using:

-SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY to filter and sort data.

-GROUP BY to aggregate data by categories or customers.

-INNER and LEFT JOINS to combine information across related tables.

-Subqueries to compare values dynamically (e.g., orders above average amount).

-Aggregate functions like SUM, AVG, and COUNT to perform data summarization.

-Views to create reusable virtual tables for recurring analysis.

-Indexing (basic understanding) to discuss optimization of query performance.

4.Tested queries using sqliteonline.com and took screenshots of outputs for documentation.


# insights extracted

-Identified customers with high-value orders.

-Found average product prices per category.

-Listed all orders with customer names using joins.

-Calculated total sales and average order amounts.

# Conclusion

i forgot the basics of SQL but this task help me regain my memory knowledge

also, This task helped me gain hands-on experience with SQL, especially in analyzing data from multiple related tables. I learned how to:

Design and populate relational databases.

Write efficient queries for both simple and advanced data analysis.

Apply joins, aggregates, and subqueries to extract meaningful insights.

Understand the importance of views and indexes in optimizing performance.
